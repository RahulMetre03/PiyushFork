# Travel-Management-System
## A Database Management System Mini project


This is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate various travel-related processes. Using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, a Travel Management System was designed to provide a comprehensive platform for users to manage their travels efficiently.

The system would allow users to search and book flights, trains and buses according to their convenience, providing them with real-time availability and pricing information. It would also facilitate the management of travel itineraries, including scheduling, reservations, and ticketing.

Users can also access their travel details, view invoices, and make payments securely through the system.
